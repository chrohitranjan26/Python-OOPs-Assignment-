        "Q1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code in which we need to create objects that contain data and methods to work with that data together in one place, just like real life. Objects represent real-world entities and contain both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:  The class is a user-defined data structure that combines the methods and data members into a single entity and it is a blueprint or template used to create objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3.  What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Object is an instance of a class and it consists of a set of methods and attributes. Actions are carried out using a class's object. Objects have two qualities: They exhibit states and actions. (The object is equipped with properties and methods) Methods represent its behaviour, while attributes represent its state. If class is a blueprint, an object is the actual item made from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:  Abstraction is the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in which it shows only important features and hides internal details and Hides complex implementation and Achieved using abstract classes / interfaces whereas Encapsulation is also the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in which it wraps data and methods together and protects the data, Binds data and methods together, Focuses on how data is protected and Achieved using classes & access control.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Dunder methods are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (__method__) and it allows custom objects to use built-in operations and operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Explain the concept of Inheritance in OOP .\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Inheritance is an important concept of OOPs method where a child class acquires properties and methods of a parent class and it means one class (child) can use the properties and methods of another class (parent).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Polymorphism is an OOP concept where the same method performs different actions depending on the object and for different objects and gets different output depending on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: encapsulation is achieved by grouping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit called a class, and together inside a class and controlling access to that data and also by using access modifiers to restrict direct access to certain components.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is a constructor in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: constructor is a special method used to initialize a new object when it is created. It is defined using the name (__init__ ). When we create an object, Python runs this method to assign initial values to the object’s variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10.  What are class and static methods in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: A class method is a method that works with the class itself, not with individual objects. It uses the decorator (@classmethod) and takes (cls) as its first parameter, which represents the class. Class methods are commonly used to access or modify class-level data whereas static method is a method that does not depend on the class or object data. It uses the decorator (@staticmethod) and does not take (self or cls) as a parameter. Static methods are used when the method logically belongs to a class but does not need to access class or instance variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is method overloading in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Overloading Method means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. However, Python does not support method overloading in the traditional way. If we want to define multiple methods with the same name in a class, Python will simply forget the first one and only use the last one. We can use overloading method by using Using default arguments (we can set a parameter to None or a default value)  and Using variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Method overriding means a child class changes the behavior of a method that it inherited from its parent class or we can say redefining  behavior of a method of child class. The overridden method in the child class has the same name and parameters as the parent’s method but provides a different implementation. This allows the child class to change the behavior of the parent class method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is a property decorator in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The property decorator (@property) is a built-in tool that accesses methods like they are regular attributes. It is mainly used to look, add, or delete private variables safely without directly accessing them. we can control how a variable is read or changed while still using simple syntax like (object.variable). This makes the code cleaner and helps protect the data inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows different objects to be treated in a similar way even if they behave differently. We  can write one function or method that works with different types of objects and It makes programs scalable, because you can add new classes without changing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. What is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: An abstract class is a class that cannot be used to create objects directly. It provide a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes can have abstract methods, which are methods declared but not implemented. Any class that inherits from an abstract class must implement all its abstract methods, otherwise it cannot be instantiated.  its only purpose is to define a set of rules (methods) that its subclass must follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are as follows:\n",
        "Modularity – Code is organized into classes, so it’s easier to manage.\n",
        "Reusability – You can reuse existing classes in new programs through inheritance.\n",
        "Encapsulation – Data is hidden inside classes and accessed only through methods, which protects it from accidental changes.\n",
        "Polymorphism – Different objects can be used interchangeably, allowing flexible and scalable code.\n",
        "Abstraction – Complex details are hidden, and you can focus on what an object does, not how it does it.\n",
        "Maintainability – Organized structure and modular code make updating and modifying programs easier.\n",
        "Real-world modeling – OOP makes it easier to represent real-world entities like cars, animals, or employees in programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: A class variable is data that is shared by every single object created from that class. It is defined outside the constructor, directly under the class name, and it belongs to the class, not a specific object, Only one copy exists, shared by all object, Can be accessed using class name or object and Used for common properties of all objects. Whereas\n",
        "\n",
        "An instance variable is data that is unique to each individual object created from a class. These are defined inside the constructor (__init__) using the self keyword. It Belongs to the object/instance, Separate copy for each object, Can be accessed only through the object and Used for individual properties of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Multiple inheritance in Python is when a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This means the child class can access attributes and methods from all its parent classes, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python .\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The ( __str__ ) method is used to provide a user-friendly, readable representation of an object. The purpose is to make the output understandable and meaningful to end users. This makes it useful whenever you want to show the object in a human-readable form.\n",
        "\n",
        "The (__repr__) method is used to provide a detailed, unambiguous version of the object for developers. It is used for debugging and logging. This method helps in understanding the object’s structure and contents more precisely, which is useful during program development and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The function is used to call methods from a parent class inside a child (subclass). It allows the child class to reuse or extend the functionality of the parent class without explicitly naming it. This is especially useful in inheritance, including multiple inheritance, because it ensures that the parent class methods are called in a safe and consistent way .\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:  This method is known as the Destructor.  It is automatically invoked when an object is about to be destroyed or removed from memory. Its main purpose is to perform cleanup tasks, such as closing files, releasing resources, or freeing memory, before the object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: A static method (@staticmethod) is a method that does not depend on the class or object. It cannot access instance variables or class variables. It is just a function that is part of the class for organizational purposes. You call it using the class name or an object. it is utility methods, independent of class or object. Whereas\n",
        "\n",
        "A class method (@classmethod) is a method that works with the class itself, not individual objects. It takes class variables as the first parameter, which refers to the class. It can access or modify class variables and is often used for alternative constructors or methods that affect the whole class. Methods that work with class data or alternative constructors\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Polymorphism with inheritance works by allowing a child class to provide its own version of a method defined in the parent class, and then calling that method on objects of different classes in the same way. This is called method overriding and is a core part of runtime polymorphism. Python decides which method to execute based on the type of object at runtime, not the type of reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Method chaining is a technique in OOP where we can call multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code, linked together by dots. Instead of performing an action, saving the result, and then performing the next action, we \"chain\" them together like a series of connected links. This makes code more concise, readable, and fluent, especially when performing multiple operations on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: ( __call__) it is a special method in python that allows an object of a class to be called like a function. When we define ( __call__ ) in a class, with parentheses on an object to execute the code inside that method. This is useful when we want objects to behave like functions while still keeping their state and other methods.\n"
